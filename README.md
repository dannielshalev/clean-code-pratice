# Clean code practice
Clean Code Practice

## SOLID stands for
- S - Single-responsibility Principle
- O - Open-closed Principle
- L - Liskov Substitution Principle
- I - Interface Segregation Principle
- D - Dependency Inversion Principle

## Our focus in solid
### Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states 
- Class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
- Function, as a class should perform just one action, and implement one logic Open-closed Principle (OCP), states:
- Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. 
- This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.


## Start the to practice

### Create virtualenv and install dependencies

```shell
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Refactor the code to be aligned with clean code - SOLID
